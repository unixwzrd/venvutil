# Changelog

## 2025-12-16: installer INSTALL_BASE + re-entry fixes

- Fixed [`setup/core.sh`](setup/core.sh) to use the actual config loader (`load_config`) so the default `INSTALL_BASE` comes from [`setup/setup.cf`](setup/setup.cf) instead of resolving to empty (which previously could cause installs into `/`).
- Added a safety guard refusing an empty or `/` `INSTALL_BASE`.
- Fixed `restart_shell` re-entry to preserve the original CLI argv (`-d`, `-v`, etc) and to preserve xtrace (`set -x`) across `exec` when enabled.
- Removed an accidental second `main "$@"` invocation in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) that could cause the installer to run twice per invocation.
- Made hard-link asset creation idempotent in [`setup/assets.sh`](setup/assets.sh) by removing an existing target before linking.
- Converted [`setup/setuplib`](setup/setuplib) into a real directory whose `.sh` files are **hard links** to the canonical [`bin/shinclude`](bin/shinclude) libraries so setup and runtime never drift.
- Added unit coverage in [`tests/test_setup_installer_safety.py`](tests/test_setup_installer_safety.py) to lock in safe defaults and prevent double-execution regressions.

## 2025-11-02: filetree pattern normalization improvements

- Added normalized handling for regex-like include/exclude inputs in [`bin/filetree.py`](bin/filetree.py), covering `.*` tokens and trailing directory slashes regardless of whether the values come from CLI flags, environment variables, or config files.
- Factored shared pattern utilities (`collect_pattern_tokens`, `normalize_patterns`) so filters behave consistently across sources.
- Introduced directory allowlisting so that specifying include directories (e.g., `src/`) limits traversal to those trees instead of surfacing matches from every folder.
- Taught pattern normalization to interpret escaped regex tokens like `.*\\.py`, ensuring commands generated by tools such as `genmd` still match the intended files.
- Adjusted [`bin/genmd`](bin/genmd) so the embedded `filetree` run changes into `GENMD_BASE` before traversal, fixing cases where the generated markdown only showed the root node.
- Added optional symlink traversal: when `genmd` is configured with `follow_links`, the generated `filetree` command now passes `-L`, and `filetree`’s tests cover symlinked directories.
- Replaced ad-hoc config handling in `genmd` with the shared `load_config`/`dump_config` utilities from [`bin/shinclude/config_lib.sh`](bin/shinclude/config_lib.sh), keeping setup, manifest, and doc generation in sync.
- Improved [`bin/tokencount`](bin/tokencount) messaging so missing `tiktoken`/NLTK assets prompt the user with the exact installation steps instead of raising an uncaught import error.
- Added unit coverage in [`tests/test_filetree_patterns.py`](tests/test_filetree_patterns.py) to lock in expected normalization behavior for `.git`, `.py`, and mixed include expressions.
- Updated [`docs/filetree.md`](docs/filetree.md) with guidance and examples that show the new normalization rules in action.

## 2025-10-29: genmd include behavior update

- Changed `-f`/`--file` (alias: `--files`) semantics to **include** only matching files in the final output after composite excludes and includes are applied.
- `-i` now targets **directory includes** (applied before file includes) to scope which directories are scanned.
- Updated `docs/genmd.md` to reflect the new behavior, adjust examples, and clarify environment variables (`GENMD_DIRECTORY_INCLUDES`, `GENMD_FILE_INCLUDES`, `GENMD_PATTERN_EXCLUDES`).

Migration notes:

- If you previously used `-f/--file` to exclude files (e.g., images), move those patterns to `-p/--pattern` or `GENMD_PATTERN_EXCLUDES`.
- Use `-i/--include` for directories (e.g., `-i "src|bin"`) and `-f/--file`/`--files` for file types (e.g., `-f "*.py *.sh"`).

### `setup.sh` Critical Bug Fix

- **Description**: Overhauled the `.bashrc` update logic to prevent file corruption and duplicate entries.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Implemented a robust, idempotent `update_bashrc` function that uses block markers (`# VENVUTIL START`/`# VENVUTIL END`) to manage its configuration section.
  - The script now automatically creates a timestamped backup of `.bashrc` before making any modifications, ensuring user configurations are safe.
  - Corrected an issue where the `venvutil` environment was not created with a specific Python version, now set to 3.12 for consistency.
  - Adjusted the installation order to ensure `.bashrc` is updated at the correct stage.

  - `to_upper`: Converts strings to uppercase.
  - `strip_space`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace.
  - `sanitize`: A flexible function to clean strings based on a custom set of allowed characters.
  - `escape_string`: Escapes special characters within a string.

### `extract_chat.py` Major Refactor

- **Complete Overhaul**: Replaced the existing script with a new version (`extract_chat2.py`) to handle complex rendering and citation requirements.
- **Tool Call Rendering**:
  - Tool calls are now rendered inline following the assistant message.
  - Each tool call is enclosed in a collapsible `<details>` section for a "window-shaded" view.
- **Advanced Citation System**:
  - Implemented a global, single-pass citation numbering system for consistency.
  - In-text citations are now robust HTML links (`<a href="...">`) pointing to anchors.
  - Citation lists are generated with unique HTML header IDs (`<h5 id="...">`) to ensure reliable linking.
  - The citation format now includes the source index and line numbers for precise traceability.
- **HTML Output Fixes**:
  - Configured the `mistune` Markdown converter to preserve raw HTML, making `<details>` sections and citation links fully interactive.
  - Fixed a critical bug that caused a mismatch between citation link `hrefs` and anchor `ids`.
- **Finalization**: The new script has replaced the old one, and temporary files have been removed.

## 2024-10-28 - Updates and stability enhancements to `genmd`

### Refactor option handling and improve configuration loading

- Centralized handling of -c and -o options.
- Enhanced display_help function to capture all help comments.
- Established configuration loading precedence: defaults, ENV, system .grc, command-line .grc.
- Improved array management and duplicate removal.
- Enhanced logging and debugging capabilities.
- Added comprehensive error handling and exit codes.
- Fixed duplicate handling in patterns written to config files.

## 2024-10-25 - Added useful markdown wrapper script, well several scripts actually

The script scans a project directory and creates a markdown document with specified directory and file patterns from the config file. Documentation is available in the docs directory.

- [filetree](docs/filetree.md): Generates a file hierarchy tree from the current directory based on specified patterns.
- [genmd](docs/genmd.md): Groups related files wrapped in markdown for easy uploading to ChatGPT. Configurations may be saved for later use.
- [chunkfile](docs/chunktext.md): Splits a file into chunks of text for ingestion by a new GPT instance while maintaining context.

## 2024-07-09 - Fixed recursion bug in pip wrapper

All functions are working properly, though cleanup and documentation updates are still needed. The wrapper functions for conda and pip are functioning as intended.
