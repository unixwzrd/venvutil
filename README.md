## Project Overview

Venvutil is a versatile toolset designed to simplify the management of Python virtual environments (VENV) and enhance the workflow for developers working with Python packages and large language models (LLMs). This project provides a collection of scripts and functions that wrap around common tools like Conda and Pip, offering additional features such as logging, environment state freezing, and streamlined package management.

### Key Features

- **Enhanced VENV Management**: Provides tools to easily create, manage, and replicate Python virtual environments and a few other tools.
- **Conda and Pip Logging**: Utilizes logging to track changes to VENV's and freeze the state of environments for reproducibility.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Maintains a log on any potentially destructive operations to VENV's when using Pip or Conda to make changes to the VENV.
- **Robust Configuration Management**: All configuration changes are logged and a `pip freeze` is done before and after the operation to ensure that the virtual environment is frozen.
- **Git Integration**: Automatically detects deleted files from git status to manage deprecated files in installations.
- **Rollback and Recovery**: Offers tools to rollback changes to VENV's, restoring the state of the environment to a previous state using the freeze log.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly on macOS and Linux systems, with specific optimizations for Apple Silicon.
- **Additional Tools**: Provides additional tools like `genmd`, `filetree`, including some simple test scripts to check if your GPU is being utilized - specifically for Apple Silicon.
- **Build and Installation Scripts**: Offers scripts to automate the setup of complex environments, including rebuilding NumPy with Apple Silicon optimizations.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes detailed instructions and [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) to help users get started and stay updated with the latest features.

### Why Use Venvutil?

- **Simplify Environment Management**: Most common tasks are simplified with this toolset, such as creating, deleting, switching, and cloning environments.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Provides a record of changes to VENV's, making it easy to track and recover from potential issues.
- **Ensure Reproducibility**: By freezing the state of environments, Venvutil helps ensure that your setups are consistent across different machines and setups.
- **Transparent Tool Wrapping**: Provides pass-through wrappers Pip, Conda, and LD to ensure compatibility without compromising security or functionality.

### Tested on the following systems

- macOS 15.3 (Sequoia)
- macOS 13.4 (Monterey)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linus 8
- Redhat Enterprise Linux 9

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Xcode command line utilities.
- Bash 4.0 or higher (macOS has Bash 3.2, you will need to build and install or use Brew)
- Python 3.11 (Conda will handle this for you when it installs)
- Conda latest version
- Python packages
  - Rich, ticktoken, nltk
- Ensure that your system meets the necessary requirements for running Python and Conda.

### Running the installer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unixwzrd/venvutil.git venvutil
cd venvutil
bash ./setup.sh install
```

By default this installs in $HOME/local/venvutil. You can override this with the -d flag. To any location you wish. The installer will download and update Conda if necessary, along with the python packages listed above. NLTK needs data and that will be downloaded into your home directory into the nltk_data directory.

Thanks for using Venvutil!

## Setup Script Enhancements

- **Hard Link Creation**: Updated `setup.sh` to include functionality for creating hard links. This change addresses issues with C++/G++/ld symlink handling, ensuring that the correct executable is called.
- **Manifest Update**: The installer manifest now supports a hard link type (`h`) in addition to symbolic links (`l`). This allows for the specification of hard links directly in the manifest file.
- **Compatibility**: The hard link creation functionality has been tested on macOS and RedHat Linux, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
- **Usage**: Use the `-h` flag in `setup.sh` to create hard links. This feature is currently untested, so proceed with caution.

  (base) [unixwzrd@xanax: ~]$ errno $?
  (EPERM: 1): Operation not permitted
  ```

There are many more functions available, check out the documentation for more.

## Conda and Pip Logging

Any potential *destructive* operations on a virtual environment swill be logged, along with the exact command used. Logs are done for the venvutil tools globally, as well as for the virtual environments themselves. A `pip freeze` is done before and after the operation to ensure that the virtual environment is frozen.

This logging combined with the frozen environments can be used to ensure that your virtual environments are consistent and reproducible as well as tracking changes and rolling back to a previous state. There are numerous commands which will work with Conda created and using either Pip or Conda for package management. I would like to add support for other package managers which may be used in a compatible virtual environments. Two useful commands are `lenv` which not only lists the environments, but also their last update date. The `ccln` command will clone the current venv and switch you to the cloned environment. There are many other useful commands and functions available, check out the [venv_funcs.sh](docs/shdoc/bin/shinclude/venv_funcs_sh.md) file for more information.

Configuration options, logs and freezes are found in the `$HOME`

## LD Pass-Through and NumPy builds

Meson was fixed which gave me troubles tracking this down, so I am removing the hard links for c++ and g++, but leaving in the ld script pass-through just in case something else tries to invoke it using the wrong flag for `--version` when it needs to be `-v`, here are the instructions for building NumPy with the optimizations turned on. It also seems that after I built GCC, it conflicted with the Xcode c++ compiler, installing another c++ in /usr/local/bin which was simply a herd link to g++.

### Recipe for building NumPy with Accelerate Framework optimizations on Apple Silicon

This has also been placed in the `numpy-comp` script, just specify version of NumPy you want to build.

```bash
CFLAGS="-I/System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Headers -Wl,-framework -Wl,Accelerate -framework Accelerate" pip install numpy==1.26.* --force-reinstall --no-deps --no-cache --no-binary :all: --no-build-isolation --compile -Csetup-args=-Dblas=accelerate -Csetup-args=-Dlapack=accelerate -Csetup-args=-Duse-ilp64=true
```

This will build and install NumPy 1.26 into your Python virtual environment. With the Accelerate Framework optimizations on, you can now use NumPy with Apple Silicon. The `numpy-comp` script will take of all teh details. There are several test scripts for NumPy and PyTorch which may be used to compare different builds for performance, these van run on multiple virtual environments for varies size NumPy arrays, PyTorch tensors and varying iterations.  These are useful for seeing what combinations of packages will give the best performance.

### Purpose

- These wrappers ensure that your existing build and compilation processes remain intact while using Venvutil.

### Explanation

- By wrapping these tools, Venvutil provides a seamless integration with your existing toolchain, ensuring compatibility and security.

## NLTK and Token Count

- **NLTK Installation**: The `venvutil` installation process includes the NLTK packages and `nltk_data`, which are necessary for the `tokencount` program.
- **Token Count**: The `tokencount` program can be invoked by `genmd` using the `-t` option to provide a token count of the markdown bundle.

## Recent Changes

- **Logging Enhancements**: (more) Improved logging with dynamic program names and lazy formatting.
- **Configuration Management**: Introduced global variable declarations and robust configuration handling in `genmd`.

## Project Status

The project is actively maintained and continuously evolving with new features and improvements. Check out the CHANGELOG.md and teh project TODO.md list for more details.
