# PerfPy-venvAI
Performance and regression test various combinations of venv builds mostly for AI

This is my collection of build scripts, benchmarking tools, and regression testing tools.  This is in a state of flux right now and I am actively working on this.

The first thing likely to emerge is a configuration for building and installing both my macOS version and the oobabooga original text-generation-webui.

Also I will be moving any Apple Silicon M1/M2 GPU performance information to this repo and it will become my location for performance related issues with macOS and Apple Silicon.

Watch this spot, more to come.
