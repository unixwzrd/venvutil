Hello! I've been working with another instance of GPT-4 on a project to collect and analyze performance data across multiple Python virtual environments (VENVs). We've been capturing various system metrics and running a set of NumPy benchmarks in these environments. The idea is to understand how different configurations and libraries affect performance.

We've modified a Python script, numpybench, to output performance times and also had a monitoring script to capture system metrics like memory usage, CPU utilization, etc., during the tests. The output is timestamped for synchronization.

Here's what I'd like to continue with:

Data Analysis: We have the performance data and system metrics timestamped. We want to do a side-by-side comparison of each test across different VENVs. Additionally, we aim to plot a time-series graph that shows system metrics over time for each test.

Visualization: We'd like to visualize this data in a way that makes it easy to compare performance across different VENVs and to understand the system load during each test.

Could you please assist in continuing this project?
